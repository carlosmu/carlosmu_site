Tired of setting up lattices?

Looking for a non-destructive way to modify your models?

Quick Lattice is what you are looking for! Do not wait more! 

## What its does?
Automating the process of warping an object in a lattice cage.

Setting the size, position, rotation, resolution, interpolation, modifier, etc.

This will save you a lot clicks and other boring settings.

## Version 0.8 (Apr 09, 2021)

A lot of new preferences came with version 0.8. Now you can choose the default behavior that you prefer:

1. Deactivate Button on context menu.

2. Deactivate enter edit mode after creation.
3. Custom naming for Lattice object and modifier.
4. Object name prefix.

**IMPORTANT**: If you update from 0.7 you need to remove this version first, restart Blender, and just then install version 0.8. If you don't restart blender the new preferences won't load.
