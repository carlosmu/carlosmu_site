      <description>Are you searching for a quick way to swap between editors?
You need more space? For example joining the outliner and properties editor?
What is this addon for?This addon will allow you to exchange editors with a button or a shortcut. The linking between editors is fully configurable. You can swap between two or more editors sequentially.
Additionally you can also hide the button if you prefer only to use the shortcut.</description>

      <description>AddonsI started making addons for blender in 2021. I am still quite new and clumsy on the subject, but I found that I can improve my workflow a bit with custom tools and I also found that they can be useful for others.
For this reason I publish my addons on Blender Market and Gumroad on a low cost, and you can always find the sources on Github of course.</description>
